Venn Fridge is a cooking site aimed at helping people discover new dishes using only the contents of their fridge. The site provides information on ingredients and recipes to help users explore the culinary arts. It also lists grocery items so users can shop for ingredients they don't have. Additionally, tags make it easy to explore or filter content catagorically. Tags include dietary restrictions, cuisines, dish types, and more.
